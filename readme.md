# **ada - a command-line RPN calculator**

## **Why a command-line calculator?**
...because keyboard entry is so much faster than pointing and clicking or tapping buttons on a touch screen.</span>

## **Why RPN?** 
...because hitting an equals key is so 1995 and using RPN is demonstrably faster than a conventional calculator.

**_ada's exclusive goal_** is to provide a app that loads fast, executes fast, and is not bloated with capabilities that you will never use because there's Excel, Jupyter Notebooks, and SAS/STAT. For example, try this with any other kind of calculator:

    4 16 s 2 ^ 4 / /

With no more than single keys, and typing a single expression, ada executes the line to result in x: 4

## **Features:**
- standard RPN number entry and execution with an unlimited stack
- easy access to lists of available commands, operators, and constants
- extensive help, including specific help for every command
- ability to use parentheses to group expressions
- read single-column data from an external file
- save your own constants
- save your own expressions, with easy recall
- unlimited memory registers
- a tape records all expressions entered during the current session
- easy retrieval of previously entered expressions
- descriptive statistics for numbers on the stack
