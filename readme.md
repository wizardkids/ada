# ada - a command-line RPN calculator

## Why a command-line calculator? 
    ...because keyboard entry is so much faster than pointing and clicking or tapping buttons on a screen.

## Why RPN? 
    ...because hitting an equals key is so 1995 and RPN is demonstrably faster than a conventional calculator.

ada loads fast, executes fast, and is not bloated with capabilities that you will never use because there's Excel, Jupyter Notebooks, and SAS. 

## Features:
- standard RPN number entry and execution with an unlimited stack
- easy access to lists of available commands, operators, and constants
- extensive help, including specific help for every command
- ability to use parentheses to group expressions
- read single-column data from an external file
- save your own constants
- save your own expressions, with easy recall
- unlimited memory registers
- a tape records all expressions entered during the current session
- easy retrieval of previously entered expressions
- descriptive statistics for numbers on the stack
